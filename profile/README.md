The UNESCO INDIA – AFRICA Hackathon provides a suitable platform allowing young innovators to come together and find solutions for social, environmental and technical problems faced by the collaborating nations. It serves as the foundation for creating potential start-ups with the potential to transform the world. It allows the participating students to unleash their creativity and explore new technologies to solve real-world problems under the guidance of experts - thus, spearheading business innovation in the modern world.

Collaboration of the student teams working together to solve shared problems opens the doors to cultural assimilation by introducing students and their mentors to methods, values and manners different from their own.

The Hackathon also serves as a symbol of the close relation cherished by India and its African counterparts and embodies the spirit of collaboration - bringing them together to solve problems for the betterment of humankind.

 # About This Project #
 
## - Problem Statement ##
*Aim* : To develop a software tool/app to calculate/estimate amount of nutrients(fertilizers quantity, irrigation required, pesticide amount, etc.) for a particular crop output.

*Description*: Unless the farmer is aware of the varying production function that is observed, there will always remain the high chance of inputs that are incorrect amounts. Precision agriculture is all about optimizing output levels by making the best use of the available, limited inputs.
Therefore a software tool/app where the farmer/user can calculate input parameters for the desired production output is needed

## - Our solution ##

Based on desired yield and crop production, we target 3 parameters:
 * Irrigation - The amount of water required for irrigation in a particular area
 * Pesticide - The amount of pesticide needed to keep plant healthy
 * Fertilizers - The certain amount of fertilizer to get maximum growth

## - Idea Approach ##

Our objective is to provide input parameters based on desired output of crop. To achieve this we firstly use :
  
 * We ask for location, date, crop type, % nutrients of fertilizers and land size.        
 * We provide the farmers with details about his land and recommendations on required irrigation amount, pesticides amount and multiple other parameters.
 * Based on the values taken so far we calculate the maximum yield that the farmer.

## - What is KrishiTech? ##
Is a website that is used to calculate the output based on input parameters for crop production
Additional Features:
  * Seasons Detection
  * User Friendly
  * Multiple Languages
  * Website can operate on 3G Mobile phones
 
** - Importance of Fertilizers **
From the graph, wheat with low phosphorus has scanty yield than wheat with sufficient phosphorus. This tells us an  addition of fertilizer to the crop has a huge impact on the yield of the wheat crop.

** - Amount vs Optimum Fertilizers **
