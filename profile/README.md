The UNESCO INDIA – AFRICA Hackathon is an annual 36 hours event that brings together students, educators, teachers, and the research community of India and its African partners to tackle the common challenges faced by their countries and serves as a facilitator for cultural amalgamation.

The UNESCO INDIA – AFRICA Hackathon provides a suitable platform allowing young innovators to come together and find solutions for social, environmental and technical problems faced by the collaborating nations. It serves as the foundation for creating potential start-ups with the potential to transform the world. It allows the participating students to unleash their creativity and explore new technologies to solve real-world problems under the guidance of experts - thus, spearheading business innovation in the modern world.

Collaboration of the student teams working together to solve shared problems opens the doors to cultural assimilation by introducing students and their mentors to methods, values and manners different from their own.

The Hackathon also serves as a symbol of the close relation cherished by India and its African counterparts and embodies the spirit of collaboration - bringing them together to solve problems for the betterment of humankind.

## - Problem Statement ##
*Aim* : To develop a software tool/app to calculate/estimate amount of nutrients(fertilizers quantity, irrigation required, pesticide amount, etc.) for a particular crop output.

*Description*: Unless the farmer is aware of the varying production function that is observed, there will always remain the high chance of inputs that are incorrect amounts. Precision agriculture is all about optimizing output levels by making the best use of the available, limited inputs.
Therefore a software tool/app where the farmer/user can calculate input parameters for the desired production output is needed
